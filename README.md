# 🧠 AI Lab

Welcome to **AI Lab** — my personal playground for experimenting with **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** projects.

Here, I explore real-world datasets, build models, test architectures, and dive into different AI domains like **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision**, and **Recommendation Systems**.
