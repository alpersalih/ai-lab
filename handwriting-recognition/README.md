# ✍️ Handwriting Digit Recognition (MNIST) – v1.0

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.  
The trained model is integrated into a simple Streamlit interface that allows users to upload digit images and get predictions instantly.
